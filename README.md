### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sergei. I want to change my profession and become a front-end developer. I hope to get more practice and meet new people. I am not afraid of difficulties. Rather being a Junior means always learning new things and believe that everything is possible.

Currently looking for work as a Front-end Developer.
